# 19AI405 FUNDAMENTALS OF ARTIFICIALINTELLIGENCE 
# Laboratory Experiments
Dear Learners,
I have created a GITHUB repo of Lab Experiments. There are about 8 Experiments, each present in a Folder with description and a Python Program associated with it.

You can download the Program and Execute and a Sample Screenshot can be taken and added to the Records.


 These are the List of Experiments
 <ol>
<li>Implement Depth First Search Traversal</li>
<li>Implement Breadth First Search Traversal</li>
<li>Implement A* Search Algorithm</li>
<li>Implement Simple Hill Climbing Algorithm</li>
<li>Implement Minimax Search Algorithm </li>
<li>Implement alpha-beta Pruning Algorithm</li>
<li>Solve Cryptarithmetic Problem</li>
<li>Implement Wumpus world Problem.</li>

 </ol>

 <strong>Note: </strong> Just Python with IDLE  in windows is more than sufficient for Execution of Programs. No third-Party Libraries are used.

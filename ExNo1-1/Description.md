<h3>Theory</h3>
<h3> The Vacuum Cleaner Agent:</h3>
<p>The Vacuum Cleaner Agent is a Python class that simulates the behavior of a basic vacuum
 cleaner in a two-location environment ("A" and "B"). The agent can perform four actions: move
 left, move right, suck dirt, and do nothing. Its state includes the current location and dirt status in
 each location. The agent's initial state is at location "A" with no dirt. Actions like moving and
 sucking dirt can change its state, and the print_status method displays the current location and
 dirt status. This agent provides a foundation for simple vacuum cleaner simulations and can be
 adapted for more complex scenarios.</p>
